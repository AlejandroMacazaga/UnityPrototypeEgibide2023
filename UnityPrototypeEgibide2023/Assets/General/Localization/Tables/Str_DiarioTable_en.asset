      and quickly jump to stab me, they lack the honour of fighting in a dignified

    m_Localized: I had never seen goats as aggressive as those in these lands. If
      their attack is not prevented a rapid descent from the peaks one can anticipate.

    m_Localized: If I wanted to reject my new crusade against the creatures of these

      with empty hands I should not return, these lost relics must obtain my forgiveness.
